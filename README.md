# STHash

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/sthash/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/sthash)

STHash is a fast, keyed, cryptographic hash function designed to process large, possibly untrusted data.

The flipside is that using a secret key (or, in this implementation, a secret seed) is mandatory. This is not a general-purpose hash function.

A typical use of STHash is to compute keys for locally cached objects.

The construction relies on:

- A composition of two ϵ-almost-∆-universal functions, NH and Poly1305. See the [Adiantum](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/7360/6530) paper for a justification of this composition.
- The cSHAKE function as a XOF to derive the NH, Poly1305 and finalization keys, and KMAC to produce the final tag.

The current code is portable, written in safe Rust, and has a lot of room for optimization.

However, it is already consistently faster than optimized BLAKE2bp and BLAKE3 implementations on all common platforms.

You can expect future versions to be even faster.

## Usage

```rust
use sthash::*;
use rand::{thread_rng, RngCore};

// This must be a random, secret seed.
let mut seed = [0u8; SEED_BYTES];
thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut seed);

// The key constructor accepts an optional application name
// Different personalization strings produce different keys
// from the same `seed`.
let key = Key::from_seed(&seed, Some(b"Documentation example"));

// Another personalization string, such as the purpose of the
// `Hasher`, can be provided here as well.
let hasher = Hasher::new(key, None);

// Returns a 256-bit hash.
let h1 = hasher.hash(b"data");

// `Hasher` structures can safely be reused to hash more data.
let h2 = hasher.hash(b"data2");
```

## Algorithm

```text
Km || Kp || Kn ← cSHAKE128(seed, c1)

Hp ← Poly1305(Kp, NH(Kn, pad128(M)))

H ← KMAC(Km, c2, pad64(|M|) || Hp)
```

`NH` is instantiated with 4 passes and a stride of 2.

`M` is processed as 1 KB chunks, and the resulting NH hashes are compressed using Poly1305 after 16 hashes have been accumulated (≡ 16 KB of `M` have been processed).

`c1` and `c2` are personalization strings.

`Kp` represents the Poly1305 random secret. In this context, we don't need to perform the final addition with an encrypted nonce.

Values are encoded as little-endian.
